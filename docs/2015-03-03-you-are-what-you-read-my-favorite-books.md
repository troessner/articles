There are a lot of inspirations in my life but books are certainly one of the most important one.

### Work and Life and Everything In Between

- [Inventors Dilemma](http://books.google.de/books/about/The_Innovator_s_Dilemma.html?id=SIexi_qgq2gC) - quite repetitive but the key message was mind-blowing to me.
- [Getting things done](http://gettingthingsdone.com) - I have my own way of task management which doesn't have to do much with GTD but I did learn a lot from it for sure.
- [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com) - my biggest influence waaaayyy back then. Still quoting from it on a regular base.
- [Rework](http://37signals.com/rework) - work less but smarter.
- [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](http://mindsetonline.com/) - after reading this I realized that I was of a "fixed mindset" in so many areas I'd always considered myself to be open-minded. Taught me that "talent" is an illusion and an excuse.
- [Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose](http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446576220/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428352401&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=zappos) - funny, witty and honest. Taught me the value of team culture.
- [How Google Works](http://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428352473&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+google+works) - yes, there is some self-marketing happening here, but it still worth your while.
- [Drive](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805) - that one was a real eye opener for me. What motivates us? Certainly not carrot and the stick.
- [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable](http://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456260202&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+5+dysfunctions+of+a+team) - That one caught me of guard quite a few times. Realising that you're showing those dysfunctions yourself can be a painful process
- [Essentialism](http://gregmckeown.com/essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less/) - Do less but better.

### Computer Science

- [Building Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do)- There are quite a few good books out there about Microservices, but I consider this to be the bible of microservices.
- [Practical Object Oriented Design](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/B00MXHDPH8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412167877&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=sandi+metz+object+oriented) - probably the best book I ever read about OOP.
- [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412168158&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clean+code) - I don't agree with quite a few chapters (especially regarding source comments. Don't do them) but overall still a very good compilation.
- [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book) - I have no idea if this style would <strong>really</strong> work with kids but it seems like worth a try given how bad most didactic books are.
- [The pragmatic programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer) - yes, today this is heavily dated material. Probably nobody would object nowadays that using a SCM is mandatory. But still one of the best books about programming.
- [Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com) - very weird book. Not sure I really understood it. On my re-read list.
- [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do) - best book about design patterns with awesome examples, especially for absolute beginners.
Should be a mandatory read for early CS classes.
- [7 Languages In 7 Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) - without that, I'd have never heard about this nice little language called [IO](http://iolanguage.org) and I certainly wouldn't have started to look into [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) which influenced me heavily.
- [Metaprogramming Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby) - best book about metaprogramming Ruby out there.
- [Continuous Delivery](http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Signature/dp/0321601912) - Agile Development in practice.
- [Ship it](https://pragprog.com/book/prj/ship-it) - Agile Development in practice, part 2. Highly influential and still relevant.
- [Domain Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) - I didn't like its didactic style (I think the book should have stuck with a couple of recurring, simple examples) but I loved most of presented ideas.
