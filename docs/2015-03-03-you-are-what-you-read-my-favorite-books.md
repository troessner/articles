## You Are What You Read

There are a lot of inspirations in my life but books are certainly one of the most important one.

### Books about science

* [Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom). Mindblowing.
* [Seven Brief Lessons on Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Brief-Lessons-Physics-Rovelli/dp/0399184414/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503666871&sr=8-1&keywords=7+lessons+in+physics). A truly wonderful book.
* [We Have No Idea: A Guide to the Unknown Universe](https://www.amazon.com/We-Have-No-Idea-Universe/dp/0735211515/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1503666913&sr=1-1&keywords=we+have+no+idea) - Popular science has never been better.
* [Riemann’s Zeta Function](https://www.amazon.com/Riemanns-Zeta-Function-Harold-Edwards/dp/0486417409/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1503666993&sr=1-1&keywords=zeta+function). I’m still at chapter 2 after 2 years, but whatever.
* [Reality Is Not What It Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity](https://www.amazon.de/Reality-Not-What-Seems-Journey/dp/0141983213/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=68115N0GBEE65RMX4PQN). Same author as “Seven Brief Lessons on Physics”. Brilliant.
* [Seven Brief Lessons on Physics](https://www.amazon.de/dp/0141981725/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_CM4ZybF11KBM9)
* [The Millenium Problems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208743.The_Millennium_Problems)
* [Fermats Last Theorem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208920.Fermat_s_Last_Theorem)

### Work and Life and Everything In Between

* [Inventors Dilemma](http://books.google.de/books/about/The_Innovator_s_Dilemma.html?id=SIexi_qgq2gC) - quite repetitive but the key message was mind-blowing to me.
* [Getting things done](http://gettingthingsdone.com) - I have my own way of task management which doesn't have to do much with GTD but I did learn a lot from it for sure.
* [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com) - my biggest influence waaaayyy back then. Still quoting from it on a regular base.
* [Rework](http://37signals.com/rework) - work less but smarter.
* [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](http://mindsetonline.com/) - after reading this I realized that I was of a "fixed mindset" in so many areas I'd always considered myself to be open-minded. Taught me that "talent" is an illusion and an excuse.
* [Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose](http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446576220/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428352401&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=zappos) - funny, witty and honest. Taught me the value of team culture.
* [How Google Works](http://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428352473&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=how+google+works) - yes, there is some self-marketing happening here, but it still worth your while.
* [Drive](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805) - that one was a real eye opener for me. What motivates us? Certainly not carrot and the stick.
* [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable](http://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456260202&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+5+dysfunctions+of+a+team) - That one caught me of guard quite a few times. Realising that you're showing those dysfunctions yourself can be a painful process
* [Essentialism](http://gregmckeown.com/essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less/) - Do less but better.
* [It doesn't have to be crazy at work](https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780/ref=sr_1_1?crid=R7V0DZ2NA7LK&keywords=it+doesnt+have+to+be+crazy+at+work&qid=1553284149&s=gateway&sprefix=it+doesnt+%2Caps%2C236&sr=8-1) - The voice of reason in a mad world.
* [Measure What Matters](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221/ref=sr_1_1?crid=FXKS686Y4IYJ&keywords=john+doerr+measure+what+matters&qid=1571440765&sprefix=john+doerr%2Caps%2C244&sr=8-1) - essential reading for everybody who wants to improve his personal and professional life by (properly) setting goals.

### Computer Science

* [Building Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do)- There are quite a few good books out there about Microservices, but I consider this to be the bible of microservices.
* [Practical Object Oriented Design](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/B00MXHDPH8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412167877&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=sandi+metz+object+oriented) - probably the best book I ever read about OOP.
* [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412168158&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clean+code) - I don't agree with quite a few chapters (especially regarding source comments. Don't do them) but overall still a very good compilation.
* [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book) - I have no idea if this style would <strong>really</strong> work with kids but it seems like worth a try given how bad most didactic books are.
* [The pragmatic programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer) - yes, today this is heavily dated material. Probably nobody would object nowadays that using a SCM is mandatory. But still one of the best books about programming.
* [Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com) - very weird book. Not sure I really understood it. On my re-read list.
* [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do) - best book about design patterns with awesome examples, especially for absolute beginners.
Should be a mandatory read for early CS classes.
* [7 Languages In 7 Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) - without that, I'd have never heard about this nice little language called [IO](http://iolanguage.org) and I certainly wouldn't have started to look into [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) which influenced me heavily.
* [Metaprogramming Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby) - best book about metaprogramming Ruby out there.
* [Continuous Delivery](http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Signature/dp/0321601912) - Agile Development in practice.
* [Ship it](https://pragprog.com/book/prj/ship-it) - Agile Development in practice, part 2. Highly influential and still relevant.
* [Domain Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) - I didn't like its didactic style (I think the book should have stuck with a couple of recurring, simple examples) but I loved most of presented ideas.
* [Exercises in Programming Style](https://www.amazon.de/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371) - Syntax matters. Semantics matter. And yes, style matters.
* [Domain-Driven Design Distilled](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Distilled-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0134434420) - “Distilled” says it all. The best primer I have seen so far.
