A couple of days ago I gave a presentation titled "How to use github to evaluate developers" for HR guys / girls and recruiters at the [HR in tech](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/hr-in-tech-berlin-tickets-20452101787) event at Zalando organised by [honeypot](https://www.honeypot.io/).

It was overall a pretty awesome event and it was fun for me to be part of this.

You can find my slides on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/troessner/how-to-use-github-to-evaluate-developers).

Zalando also published the talk on theirÂ [youtube channel](https://youtu.be/7qFmLNESHJ0?t=2597).
